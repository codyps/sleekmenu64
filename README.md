A game browser for the EverDrive-64 X7 and Pro: box art, genres,
descriptions and filters for your N64 library, and the game you pick boots
straight from it. It is an ordinary ROM on the card, started from the
EverDrive's own menu, which stays where it is; saves go to the same
`ED64/gamedata/` folder, so a game carries its save between the two menus.
On an X7 the console can start straight in it.

## Install

You need an EverDrive-64 X7 (OS 3.11) or Pro with your ROMs on the card, in
any folders you like, and a Mac, a Windows PC or a Linux computer. Nothing
to install.

**1. Download two files** from the
[releases page](https://github.com/codyps/sleekmenu64/releases):
`SleekMenu64.z64` and the Game Catalog Manager for your computer.

| Your computer | The Game Catalog Manager |
|---|---|
| Mac with Apple silicon or an Intel processor | `SleekMenu-Catalog-Manager-mac-universal.zip` |
| Windows | `SleekMenu-Catalog-Manager-windows.exe` |
| Linux | `SleekMenu-Catalog-Manager-linux` |

**2. Copy `SleekMenu64.z64` to the root of the card.**

**3. Open the Game Catalog Manager.** On a Mac, unzip it first. It is not
code-signed, so the first launch warns. On macOS 15 and later, open it
once, then press Open Anyway in System Settings → Privacy & Security
(earlier macOS: right-click → Open). On Windows: More info → Run anyway. On
Linux: `chmod +x SleekMenu-Catalog-Manager-linux` first.

**4. Set up the card.** It is picked for you when it is the only removable
disk. Press **Set up card**: it fetches a box and a description for each of
your games onto the card, then writes the catalog. Up to about 330 MB for a
complete library, once; you can stop and carry on later.

**5. Put the card back in the cart and start `SleekMenu64.z64` from the
EverDrive menu.** Start plays a game,
A shows its details; reset the console to get back to the EverDrive menu.

**Adding games later:** copy them on, open the Game Catalog Manager, press
**Update card**. Only what changed is read and only the new games' boxes
are fetched. Until then a new game still shows up and plays, just without
its box.

**Starting the console in SleekMenu:** an X7 can power on straight into
it; see [below](#starting-the-console-in-sleekmenu-x7-only).

**Themes:** the browser comes in six sets of colours: Midnight, Charcoal,
Jungle, Grape, Fire and Ice. Change it on the console (Z, then the THEME
row) or under **Console** on the Game Catalog Manager's Card tab.

The Game Catalog Manager also shows your card the way the console will, and
lets you give any game your own picture, description or facts; see
[docs/PREP.md](docs/PREP.md).

![The Game Catalog Manager's Games tab: the card's games on the left; on the right the selected game's box, its title, genre, publisher, year, players and region in fields, and its description in a box below](docs/screenshots/tool.png)

Descriptions come from the
community-maintained
[n64-flashcart-menu-metadata](https://github.com/n64-tools/n64-flashcart-menu-metadata)
collection, boxes from
[libretro-thumbnails](https://github.com/libretro-thumbnails/Nintendo_-_Nintendo_64)
and, when you ask for them, cheat codes from
[libretro-database](https://github.com/libretro/libretro-database);
SleekMenu ships none of them.

## Using it

| Control | Browsing | A game's details |
|---|---|---|
| D-pad / stick | Move; hold to keep moving, faster the longer you hold | Scroll the description |
| A | Open a folder, or a game's details | The box, full screen |
| B | Parent folder | Back to the list |
| Start | Play | Play |
| C-left / C-right | Previous / next genre tab | — |
| C-up | List, grid or coverflow | Fast or verified load |
| C-down | Favourite | Cheats |
| L / R | Page up / down (coverflow: previous / next letter) | — |
| Z | Filters and theme | Diagnostics |

The bar along the bottom of every screen says what the buttons do there,
each button drawn in its own colour: a blue A, a green B, a red Start, the
yellow C buttons with their arrow.

The first two tabs are your favourites and the last fifteen games you
played. The **grid** shows twelve covers at a time; **coverflow** shows one
face on, with the facts, the start of the description and a strip of
initials under the shelf.

![Coverflow, in the Ice theme: the selected box face on with the shelf receding on both sides; under it the title, the facts, the start of the description and a strip of initials](docs/screenshots/coverflow.png)

![The details: the box on the left; the title, year, publisher, genre, region, players, save type, cheats, size and needed accessories beside it; the description below, and the buttons under it](docs/screenshots/detail.png)

## Starting the console in SleekMenu (X7 only)

An EverDrive-64 X7 can power on straight into SleekMenu, without a stop in
the EverDrive menu. The X7's OS starts a file named `autoexec.v64` in the
card's `ED64` folder by itself when there is one, so SleekMenu only has to
be that file. Two ways to put it there:

- **By hand:** copy `SleekMenu64.z64` into the card's `ED64` folder and
  rename the copy `autoexec.v64`. Only the name changes; nothing is
  converted. Do it again when you install a newer SleekMenu.
- **With the Game Catalog Manager:** tick **Start the console in
  SleekMenu** on the Card tab and press Update card. It makes the same copy
  and keeps it up to date when you replace `SleekMenu64.z64`.

From then on the console powers on in SleekMenu. A reset inside a game
returns to the EverDrive menu, where `SleekMenu64.z64` is still at the card
root to start again. To go back, delete `ED64/autoexec.v64`, or untick the
box and update. It needs a recent X7 OS; 3.11 has it.

**The EverDrive-64 Pro cannot do this.** Its menu is part of the
cartridge's firmware and has no start-up file, so on a Pro SleekMenu is
always started from the EverDrive menu. More in
[docs/CONSOLE.md](docs/CONSOLE.md#starting-the-console-in-sleekmenu).

## Good to know

- **On the Pro,** let the EverDrive menu boot once after playing before you
  pull the card: that is when the stock menu writes the save out.
- **Hacks** that black-screen on a console because of a stale header
  checksum are fixed as they launch.
- **Cheats** come from the EverDrive-64 Pro's cheat pack in `ED64/CHEATS/`,
  or from libretro when you tick **Fetch cheat codes** on the Game Catalog
  Manager's Card tab, and need an Expansion Pak.
- **`.z64` and `.v64`** dumps load; `.n64` ones do not — convert them first.

Everything else about the console — the screens, saves, the clock, 64DD,
cheats in detail — is in [docs/CONSOLE.md](docs/CONSOLE.md).

## Building from source

Needs a [libdragon](https://github.com/DragonMinded/libdragon) toolchain.

```sh
make test                                   # host-side tests, no hardware needed
make slim N64_INST=/path/to/libdragon       # build/release/SleekMenu64.z64
make prep                                   # the Game Catalog Manager, as a .pyz
make perf N64_INST=/path/to/libdragon       # the ROM with a frame-time readout
```

`make help` lists the rest.

The `release` GitHub Actions workflow builds the downloadable desktop apps.
Run it manually to get build artifacts without creating a release; pushing a
`v*` tag creates a draft release after the builds and smoke tests pass.
The Mac ZIP contains one universal2 app for Intel and Apple silicon, built
with python.org's universal2 Python and merged Pillow wheels. The same ZIP
is tested on both architectures, including card preparation and drag and drop.
